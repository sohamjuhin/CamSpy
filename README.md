# CamSpy
webcam key logger
This code will first take a screenshot and a picture from the webcam. Then, it will create a new thread to run the remote access tool. The remote access tool can be any program that allows you to control the computer remotely. For example, you could use a program like TeamViewer or AnyDesk.

Once the remote access tool is running, you will be able to control the computer from another computer or device. You can use the remote access tool to view the desktop, open and close applications, and even type on the keyboard.

To run the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

pyautogui
time
cv2
threading
###You can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal:


pip install pyautogui time cv2 threading


Once the libraries are installed, you can run the code by saving it as a Python file and then running it from the command line. For example, if you saved the code as remote_access.py, you would run it by typing the following command in your terminal


python remote_access.py



This will take a screenshot, a picture from the webcam, and then start the remote access tool. You can then connect to the remote access tool from another computer or device.
